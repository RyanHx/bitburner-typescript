/**
 * This function calculates the number of threads needed to grow a server from one $amount to a higher $amount
 * (ie, how many threads to grow this server from $200 to $600 for example). Used primarily for a formulas (or possibly growthAnalyze)
 * type of application. It lets you "theorycraft" and easily ask what-if type questions. It's also the one that implements the
 * main thread calculation algorithm, and so is the function all helper functions should call.
 * It protects the inputs (so putting in INFINITY for targetMoney will use moneyMax, putting in a negative for start will use 0, etc.)
 * @param {Server} server - Server being grown
 * @param targetMoney - How much you want the server grown TO (not by), for instance, to grow from 200 to 600, input 600
 * @param startMoney - How much you are growing the server from, for instance, to grow from 200 to 600, input 200
 * @param p - Reference to Player object
 * @returns Number of "growth cycles" needed
